  "Title": "elFinder PHP Connector exiftran Command Injection",
  "Discription": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in elFinderversions prior to 2.1.48.The PHP connector component allows unauthenticated users to uploadfiles and perform file modification operations, such as resizing androtation of an image. The file name of uploaded files is not validated,allowing shell metacharacters.When performing image operations on JPEG files, the filename is passedto the `exiftran` utility without appropriate sanitization, causingshell commands in the file name to be executed, resulting in remotecommand injection as the web server user.The PHP connector is not enabled by default.The system must have `exiftran` installed and in `$PATH`.This module has been tested successfully on elFinder versions 2.1.47,2.1.20 and 2.1.16 on Ubuntu.",
